Data Visualization and Analytics Boot Camp Challenge 15

An interactive map showing earthquake data over the past seven days.

##



## Notes on sources

The source of the earthquake data is the USGS GeoJSON Feed (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

Code for the following were adapted from answers provided by ChatGPT:
1. the 'markerColor' function;
2. the 'pointToLayer' part of the 'earthquakes' variable within the 'createFeatures' function;
3. the for loop within the legend creation.

Additional code for the legend was based on the top answers to the following StackExchange answers:
- https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/133630/adding-leaflet-legend
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53197987/changing-legend-background-color-with-css-javascript

HTML color names were found at w3 schools (https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_groups.asp).
